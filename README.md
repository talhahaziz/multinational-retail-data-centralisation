# Multinational Retail Data Centralisation

In this project I'm acting as an employee of a multinational retail company that sells products accross the world.

Currently, their sales data is spread across many different data sources so its quire difficult to analyse or access by memebers of the team 

In an effort to become more data-driven the organisation would like to make its sales data accessible from one centralised location.

My first goal will be to produce a system that stores the current company data in a database so it's accessed from one centralised location and acts as a single source of trust for sales data. 

I will then query the database to get up-to-date metrics for business. 

## Milestone 1 

- Creates a remote github repository for this project to version control the software.

- Connects the remote repository to a local clone using the command line.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/talhahaziz/multinational-retail-data-centralisation
```

## Milestone 2

- Set up a database 'sales_data' within pgadmin4. I will use this database to store company information that I extract from various sources. 

- Created data_extraction.py which will be used to extract and clean the data
