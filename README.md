# Multinational Retail Data Centralisation

In this project I'm acting as an employee of a multinational retail company that sells products accross the world.

Currently, their sales data is spread across many different data sources so its quire difficult to analyse or access by memebers of the team 

In an effort to become more data-driven the organisation would like to make its sales data accessible from one centralised location.

My first goal will be to produce a system that stores the current company data in a database so it's accessed from one centralised location and acts as a single source of trust for sales data. 

I will then query the database to get up-to-date metrics for business. 

## Milestone 1 

- Creates a remote github repository for this project to version control the software.

- Connects the remote repository to a local clone using the command line.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/talhahaziz/multinational-retail-data-centralisation
```

## Milestone 2 (Task - 1,2 & 3)

- Set up a database 'sales_data' within pgadmin4. I will use this database to store company information that I extract from various sources. 

- Initialised the three classes which will be used to clean, extract and connect the data

    1. DataExtractor class - responsible for methods used to extract data from the data sources. The sources will include a  CSV file, an API and an S3 bucket.

    1. DatabaseConnector class - used to connect to the database and upload the cleaned data ready for analysis.

    1. DataCleaning class - include methods to clean the data from the various sources. 

- Added the database credentials to the .yaml file and included a .gitignore to ensure the credentials are not uploaded to Github.

- Created the following methods in the DatabaseConnector class which will be used to connect and retrieve data from the AWS database:

    1. read_db_creds(): read the AWS database credentials from a YAML file and return a python dictionary of said credentials. 

    1. init_db_engine(): uses the read_db_cred() method to retrieve database credentials and uses these to initialise and return a SQLalchemy engine connecting to the database.

    1. list_db_tables(): lists the tables present in the database so I know which tables I can extract the data from

    1. upload_to_db(): takes in a pandas dataframe and table name and uploads them to the local sales_db database setup within pgadmin4

- Created 
    1. read_rds_table: In DatabaseExtractor class in data_extraction.py which extracts the database table to a pandas dataframe. 

- Created a new method in the DataCleaning class:

    1. cleam_user_data: this method takes in the tables removing Null values, date errors, incomplete rows and incorrect information.

## Milestone 2 Task 4

- Created the method 'retrieve_pdf_data' in the DataExtractor class which uses the tabula-py library to extract data from a pdf file into a pandas dataframe. 

```python
def retrive_pdf_data(self, link):

        table = tabula.read_pdf(link, pages='all')
        table_df = pd.concat(table)

        return table_df
```
- Created the method 'clean_card_details' in the DataCleaning class to clean the card details data so it is ready to be uploaded to the postgres database.

- Used the upload_to_db method in the DatabaseConnector class to store the cleaned card details in the postgres database

```python
def upload_to_db(self, df, table_name):
        
        # uses read_db_creds method to read the sales_data database credentials
        db_creds = self.read_db_creds('sales_data_creds.yaml')

        engine = create_engine(f"postgresql+psycopg2://{db_creds['RDS_USER']}:{db_creds['RDS_PASSWORD']}@{db_creds['RDS_HOST']}:{db_creds['RDS_PORT']}/{db_creds['RDS_DATABASE']}")
        df.to_sql(table_name, engine, if_exists='replace', index=False, index_label='index')

db_connect = DatabaseConnector()
db_connect.upload_to_db(table, 'dim_card_details')
```

## Milestone 2 Task 5
Task 5 is concerned with retrieving the store data through the use of an API, cleaning and storing it in the postgres database.

- Created the method 'list_number_of_stores' in the DataExtractor class which sends a GET request to the endpoint storing the number of stores there are. Through this I will know how many stores need to be extracted from the API.

```python
def list_number_of_stores(self, endpoint):

    url = endpoint 

    # reads in the x-api-key needed for authorisation and saves it as 'headers' which will be sent with the request
    connect = DatabaseConnector()
    headers = connect.read_db_creds('api_key.yaml')

    response = requests.get(url, headers=headers)

    data = response.json()
    number_of_stores = data['number_stores']

    return number_of_stores
```

- Defined the method 'retrieve_store_data' in the same class which uses a for loop to first change the {store_number} parameter in the API endpoint to the required store index and then retrieves it. 

- Each store is stored in the store_details list as a dictionary, this is then used to create a pandas dataframe. 

```python
def retrieve_stores_data(self, endpoint):

    url = endpoint

    connect = DatabaseConnector()
    headers = connect.read_db_creds('api_key.yaml')

    # calls the list_number_of_stores method to retrieve the amount of stores 
    number_of_stores = self.list_number_of_stores('https://aqj7u5id95.execute-api.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/prod/number_stores')

    # empty list which will store each of the store details as a dictionory. This will be used to create the dataframe
    stores_list = []

    # sends a get request for each store 
    for i in range(number_of_stores):
        
        # replaces the parameter '{store_number}' for i which is a store index
        new_url = url.replace('{store_number}', str(i))
        response = requests.get(new_url, headers=headers)
        data = response.json() 
        stores_list.append(data)

    # creates a pandas dataframe from the list of dictionaries storing store details 
    store_data_df = pd.DataFrame(stores_list)

    return store_data_df
```
- Created the method clean_store_details in the DataCleaning class which cleans the store details and uploads the clean pandas dataframe to postgres

```python
# sets the index of the pandas dataframe 
table.set_index('index', inplace=True)

# removes 'lat' column which is not needed and is only filled with null values 
table.drop('lat', axis=1, inplace=True)

# some of the values in the continent column have an error where they begin with 'ee' but are otherwise correct. This removes the 'ee' substring from those rows. 
table['continent'] = table['continent'].str.replace('ee', '')

# changes 'country_code', 'continent' and 'store_type' columns data type to category
table['country_code'] = table['country_code'].astype('category')
table['continent'] = table['continent'].astype('category')
table['store_type'] = table['store_type'].astype('category')

# Defines a set of valid country codes and removes rows where the column entry does not match these. This removes rows filled with null values and incorrect data. 
country_codes = {'GB', 'US', 'DE'}
inconsistent_categories = set(table['country_code']) - country_codes
inconsistent_rows = table['country_code'].isin(inconsistent_categories)
table = table[~inconsistent_rows]   

# removes any alphabetical characters from rows in the staff_numbers column using a regular expression so they are ready to be converted to data type int
table['staff_numbers'] = table['staff_numbers'].str.replace(r"[a-zA-z]", '')

# changes the staff_numbers data type to numberic so it can used for calculations
table['staff_numbers'] = pd.to_numeric(table['staff_numbers'])

# uses to_datetime() method to correct date entries in the opening_date column and changes the column data type to datetime
table['opening_date'] = pd.to_datetime(table['opening_date'], infer_datetime_format=True, errors='coerce')
table['opening_date'] = table['opening_date'].astype('datetime64[ns]')
# removes timestamp from column as only the date is required 
table['opening_date'] = table['opening_date'].dt.date
```
